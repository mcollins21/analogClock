# analogClock

The clock program is a Java application that shows a clock on your computer screen. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) with a window that displays the clock.

When you run the program, a window appears with a clock face. The clock has hour, minute, and second hands that move to show the current time. The hour hand shows the current hour, the minute hand shows the current minute, and the second hand shows the current second. 

The clock face also has numbers around it to represent the hours. These numbers help you quickly read the time on the clock. Additionally, there are small marks between the numbers that indicate the seconds, so you can see the seconds ticking by.

The program updates the clock every second, so you always see the correct time. It does this by using the computer's system clock to get the current time and then drawing the clock hands and numbers accordingly.

## Getting Started 

- Open the clock program on your computer.
- A window will appear displaying an analog clock.
- Observe the hour, minute, and second hands to see the current time.
- The time that is displayed corresponds to your computer's internal clock. (If displaying an incorrect time check your computer's settings first.)
- Close the clock program when you no longer need it.
